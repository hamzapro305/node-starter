## 🚀 <span style="color: #00BCD4;">Project Description</span>
Node Starter is a backend framework designed to streamline the development of scalable and maintainable applications using **Node.js**. Built with **Express.js** and leveraging a **modular architecture** based on the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, this project emphasizes clarity, flexibility, and scalability. It also incorporates **global exception handling** for a robust development experience.

## 🌟 <span style="color: #FFC107;">Features</span>
- 🎯 **Modular Architecture**: Follow the **MVC** pattern for better organization and separation of concerns.
- ⚡ **Express.js**: Leverage the powerful routing and middleware capabilities of Express for fast and efficient APIs.
- 🛠️ **Dependency Injection**: Using **Tsyringe** for simplified dependency management and inversion of control.
- ⚠️ **Global Exception Handling**: Automatically catch and handle errors across your application.
- 🔄 **Controller-Repository-Service Layer**: Organized structure for easy maintainability and scalability.
